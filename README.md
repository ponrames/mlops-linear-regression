# mlops-linear-regression
This repository demonstrates the implementation of MLOps principles for managing machine learning models


## Overview
This repository contains two versions of a linear regression model trained on the `sampregdata` dataset.

## Model Versions
- **v1.0**: Uses a single best feature (`x2`). This model has an R² score of X.
- **v2.0**: Uses additional two features (`x1`, `x2` and `x4 `). The performance improved with an R² score of Y.

The second model (v2.0) has better predictive power, reducing error by Z%. However, adding more features might lead to overfitting.
